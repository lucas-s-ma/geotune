`torch_dtype` is deprecated! Use `dtype` instead!
Some weights of EsmModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at facebook/esm2_t30_150M_UR50D and are newly initialized: ['pooler.dense.bias', 'pooler.dense.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
